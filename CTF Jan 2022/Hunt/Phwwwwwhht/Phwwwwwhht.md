## Answer

```
flag{EdwardSnowden} 
```

## Solution
The image is of a literal `SNOW DEN`.  

This was hard to get at the first glace therefore 3 other images are provided

```
Eagle image : Logo of NSA (National Security Agency)
E looking logo : Logo of a company named ECHELON
Prism : Image of Prism (duh :\)
```
If you google `NSA` , `ECHELON` and `Prism` together you would have found Edward Snowden.
