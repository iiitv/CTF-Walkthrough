```

## Solution


As the Question clearly states the word "genes", it is a clear indication of DNA Cipher. Second hint for the same was in the Code where the terms AGCT are used which are the 4 types of DNA molecules present namely adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).

Though to decrypt the cipher you will need to download the image of wormtail.(the name of the file is huehuehuehint.jpeg)

The cipher code is hidden in the image using steganography, so to run the file you will need a password! The password is this is "genes". After decrypting this it will take you to a google drive which contains the dna_code.

Decrypt the DNA Code using the cipher and get your flag!
